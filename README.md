# x to fixupx

This extension is an altered version of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vxtwitter-url-converter/

When sharing a Twitter post throught Share -> Copy link, the copied link will be changed to fixupx.com.
The purpose of this extension is to easily share posts to Discord, since Twitter videos and nsfw posts aren't shown on Discord (thank elon)
